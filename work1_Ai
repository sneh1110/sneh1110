#install required libraries: You need to install the required libraries, including NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, and Pillow (PIL). You can install them using pip, the Python package manager

#Prepare the input image: Place the input image that you want to use for the genetic algorithm in the same directory as your Python script.

#Run the code: Execute the Python script by running it through your terminal or IDE. If you're using a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where your Python script is located and run it using the following command: python Ai_ass.py

#View the result: The script will execute the genetic algorithm and display the best individual (image with blurred squares) that approximates the input image. You should see the result displayed on your screen
